## Overview

This is meant for developers with a basic understanding of git.

The goal is to get hands-practice with what I deem the bare minimum git knowledge:

* retrieving and branching off of existing repositories
* modifying the content of a repository
* exposing modifications in a clean, logical and easily reviewable way


## Caveat Emptor

This workshop is meant for a very specific kind of git workflow:

* central repository

* features implemented in branches

* approved modifications merged into a main branch


The practice gained here might not be sufficient for all workflows.

This workshop is meant to demistify some of the common scenarios, and is not a substitue to actually learning git.
